Clustering of resumes into various job profiles using K-Means and TF-IDF

Resumes contain a lot of information but not all of it will be considered as important. Our intentions may differ according to our requirements. We might be looking for specific entities like years of experience, job roles, etc. An automated way of classifying resumes according to various profiles will help us reap a lot of benefits and tremendously reduce the amount of time we have to spend skimming through resumes. This article demonstrates the implementation of clustering resumes according to various profiles using K -Means Clustering.
K-Means Clustering
K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster while keeping the centroids as small as possible. The optimal number of clusters can be selected using the elbow method.

TF-IDF

Term Frequency -Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a statistical measure that evaluates how relevant a word is to a document in a collection of documents. This is done by multiplying two metrics: how many times a word appears in a document, and the inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents.


Input 

The input files are resumes with extension (.txt)


Output 

Resumes clustered based on various profiles
