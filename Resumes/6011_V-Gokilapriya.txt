Academic Projects
UG project on Automatic License Plate Recognition:

To design and implement algorithms to localize, segment and recognize the characters of
the Indian license plates without human intervention. The objective is to develop a method
that is less time consuming and more efficient. Nowadays, this project helps in the
development of smart applications such as Automatic Toll Collection, Parking systems and
many more.

M.S. (By Research) on Energy Efficient Topology Discovery Mechanism for 6LoWPAN Network
To analyze the impact of IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low –Power and Lossy Networks
(RPL) in extending the lifetime of IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks
(6LoWPAN) based applications. The analysis of RPL protocol is carried out for different
topologies namely linear, ellipse, random, manual and for varied network sizes. The
performance metrics evaluated are Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Round Trip Time (RTT)
and energy consumption in the network. The Cooja Simulator of Contiki Operating System
was used for evaluation.
